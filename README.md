# Anomaly_Detection
Master thesis script.
In this thesis document, we create an anomaly detection system for the edge device using machine learning techniques to improve 
the security level of the IoT system. We perform binary classification models that detects normal and abnormal connections. 
Algorithms include decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression and random forest applied on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. 
We achieve a maximum accuracy 99.32%.
With the increase of data generation from the IoT devices, edge computing (EC) moves data processing from the cloud to the edge 
nodes(ENs), increasing the quality of service for the IoT applications. IoT service framework contains four layers: device, network, 
edge and cloud. All these layers are connected to each other, but the IoT architecture is considered an open system which expands 
the scope of potential cyberattacks. Various types of security threats could occur at the terminal perception, network transport layer 
and the application service layer. 
Automation, intelligence, big data processing, learning and predictive capability, computational efficiency, robustness, generalization 
and high accuracy are important characteristics for artificial intelligence. These advantages allow machine learning to outperform 
traditional methods for cybersecurity, making it one of the top use cases in edge computing. Intrusion detection system(IDS) has 
gained a significant consideration among the best security mechanisms for safeguarding the IoT cyber infrastructures. Supervised 
learning such as support vector machine (SVM), unsupervised learning such as k-means clustering, and deep learning such as artificial 
neural network (ANN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been implemented achieving high accuracies on various IoT security 
datasets
